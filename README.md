Phone for You is a company that sells smartphones through several stores. The company has
several partners at national level who are responsible for the company's sales. Phone for You not only
sends the equipment that is sold in each of the stores, but also supports the service
of product returns.
As a result of considerable growth in recent years, Phone for You aims for every
one of its partners to present a monthly sales report for its
products/smartphones, as well as the returns that were made. To do this, each partner will have
to implement a module in your computer system that exports information essentially about
sales and returns.
To support the sending of each partner's sales and returns report, it was decided to provide a
XML vocabulary in order to facilitate the integration of data from each partner. In this way, each
partner will have to implement in their IT systems a module that supports the generation of
XML documents (sales and returns) according to the established vocabulary.
